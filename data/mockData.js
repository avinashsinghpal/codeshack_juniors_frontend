Focus on STL (Standard Template Library) - it has built-in data structures like vectors, maps, sets, etc.\n\nHere's why C++ is better for competitive programming:\n1. Faster execution time\n2. Better control over memory\n3. STL provides efficient implementations\n4. Most online judges are optimized for C++\n\nStart with basic problems on Codeforces and LeetCode. Practice consistently!",
